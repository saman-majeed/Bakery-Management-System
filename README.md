# Bakery-Management-System
The Sweet Heaven Bakery Database Management System is designed to help manage the bakery’s daily operations smoothly and efficiently. It keeps track of customers details, their orders, the products offered by the bakery, and the ingredients needed to make them. The system makes it easy to store customer details and link them to their orders, so the bakery can provide better service. Each order includes details like the products ordered, their quantities, and the total cost, ensuring everything is recorded properly.
The database also keeps a record of the ingredients used to make products and the suppliers who provide them. This helps the bakery manage its stock and make sure they always have the necessary ingredients available. For production, the system logs details like production dates, batch numbers, and quantities made, which helps track the products and refill stock as needed.
To ensure everything is up to date, the system includes stock tables for both finished products and ingredients. These tables show how much is available and when the stock was last updated. Additionally, any changes, like updated product prices or order amounts, are saved in history tables, so there’s always a record of what has been changed and why.
Overall, this database helps the bakery manage its work better, keep everything organized, and serve customers more efficiently.
